      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/troy pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Here's Troy!">

      <p>My career has always revolved around solving problems and being creative. After graduating from college, I spent
        several years behind the scenes in TV news before going back to school to earn my meteorology certification. That
        afforded me the opportunity to move in front of the camera as a morning meteorologist and agricultural reporter.
        Most recently, I worked in the communications department at Mississippi State University where I led the weekly production
        of a nationally-aired broadcast. Duties there included writing content, anchoring the show, social media management,
        network distribution and community outreach.
        <br>
        <br> That’s where I’ve been. So where do I see myself going? Some of my greatest strengths include collaborating with
        a team, managing multiple projects and working on a deadline. When combined with an ever-expanding web development knowledge and my ability to communicate to a variety
        of audiences, I think my skills are best suited for a job as a web
        developer, technical business analyst or project manager.
        <br>
        <br> My past jobs have always been about taking that big idea and developing numerous ways to communicate it to an audience
        or client. Now, I’m eager to do it through the prism of web and technology.
